          <p>You may also practice some of the <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1eP23cwBwAqt549CvP7UGjrhvHRDwdQKp?usp=sharing">python programming exercises</a>.</p>

          <h2 id="online-tools">Online Tools</h2>

          <p>Some of the classes will be conducted online using the following setup.</p>

          <p>The course will use the following <a href="http://www.discord.com">Discord</a> server
              to support discussions.
              The link to the discord server is <a href="https://discord.gg/Rhq49AsnU5">https://discord.gg/Rhq49AsnU5</a>.</p>

          <p>Make sure that you pay attention to the messages on the server. Links to
              additional course material, assignments, and tests will be posted on discord only.</p>

          <h2 id="textbook-and-lecture-materials">Textbook and Lecture Materials</h2>

          <p>I will use research papers describing both the background material as well as the
              current state of the art.
              Students are expected to understand the material as well as being able to implement
              simple versions of the described algorithm. </p>

          <h2 id="academic-dishonesty">Academic Dishonesty</h2>

          <p>Students are reminded that there are penalties for academic dishonesty.
              Academic dishonesty includes submitting assignments that are not entirely the studentâ€™s own work.
              A declaration sheet, which states that the work being submitted is completely your own, is  available here
              <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VBXr9XeQqVWjMotxhb0qhim5mFffQ85YU86El-wlkZ0/edit?usp=sharing">honesty declaration</a>.
              This sheet must be filled out and attached to all assignments or projects,
              which you are submitting as part of your class work.
              No assignment or project will be marked unless the declaration is attached.</p>

          <h2 id="registration-advisory">Registration Advisory</h2>

          <h2 id="major-disruptions">Major Disruptions</h2>

          <p>Should major disruptions to university activities occur as a result of a pandemic,
              the course content, marks breakdown, and other provisions of this document may be
              adjusted as the circumstances warrant.</p>
